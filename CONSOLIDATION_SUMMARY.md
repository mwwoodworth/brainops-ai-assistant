## Directories DELETED (completed):

1. **fastapi-operator-env-backup/** - All valuable content has been migrated to the main repo ✅
2. **fastapi-operator-env/fastapi-operator-env/** - Nested duplicate directory ✅

## Directories to KEEP (active projects):

1. **brainops-ai-assistant/** - Active project (as per user instructions)
2. **myroofgenius-app/** - Separate frontend application
3. **weathercraft/** - Separate weather monitoring service
4. **fastapi-operator-env/** - Main production repository (consolidated)

## Production Repository Location

All future development and deployment should occur in:
`~/brainstackstudio/fastapi-operator-env`

This is now the single source of truth containing:
- All backend API code
- Router implementations for auth, RAG, webhooks, and AI streaming
- Production configuration and deployment guides
- Comprehensive test suite
- All required dependencies for production deployment

## Next Steps

1. Review this summary
2. Confirm deletion of backup directories
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines to point to fastapi-operator-env
4. Ensure all team members know the consolidated repository location
