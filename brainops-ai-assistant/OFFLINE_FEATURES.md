- **Voice Memos**: Audio recordings and transcriptions

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Installable as a native app
- Works offline like a native application
- Push notifications for sync updates
- App shortcuts for quick actions

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. The app automatically registers the service worker on first load
2. Allow persistent storage when prompted for best experience
3. The offline status indicator appears in the top-right corner

### Offline Actions
- **Chat**: Type messages normally - they'll be queued and sent when online
- **Voice**: Click the microphone button to record voice memos
- **Files**: Upload files - they'll be cached and uploaded when online
- **Tasks**: Create and manage tasks - all changes sync automatically

### Sync Management
