Automation Pipelines
A core feature of BrainStackStudio’s platform is the ability to run multi-step automation pipelines that
involve different AI agents and tools. Below we define the key automation pipelines the system will support,

Each of these pipelines is defined in the LangGraph (see below) so that the sequence of agents and actions
is declarative. Operators can trigger these pipelines manually (via the dashboard UI or Slack commands) or
a bundle pipeline to onboard a customer). All pipelines are designed to be retryable and traceable: if any
retries and escalation as described later). By using LLMs as the building blocks, these automation pipelines
LangGraph Multi-Agent Routing
To coordinate the above pipelines, we introduce LangGraph, a YAML-defined graph of agents and decision
nodes that routes tasks to the appropriate AI model or tool in sequence. LangGraph provides a high-level
YAML Structure: The agents/langgraph.yaml file will define the nodes, edges, and any conditional

In this YAML, agents defines each node: Claude (id claude_max ) is configured as a large-context model
input to the next. The flows section then strings these nodes together for specific named pipelines. For
logic can be supported either by YAML (with a condition field as shown) or handled in code by the
Routing Logic: The LangGraph orchestrator ( agents/base.py or similar) will read the YAML graph and
handle the execution logic. When a request comes in to run a pipeline (for example, the /task/generate
endpoint might correspond to a flow name in the YAML), the orchestrator starts at the start node and
